# API Spec Requirements

Superflows accepts the open standard '[OpenAPI Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0)' to read API Specifications.

Versions 3.0+ are accepted. If you have a version 2.X OpenAPI specification, you can [**convert it here**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59749513/how-to-convert-openapi-2-0-to-openapi-3-0).

OpenAPI specifications can be uploaded in `.json`, `.yaml` or `.txt` formats.

### About OpenAPI Specifications

OpenAPI Specifications are an open industry standard for defining APIs. A full definition and description can be found on the [OpenAPI Initiative website](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0).

The initiatives website describes the specification format as follows:

>*The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. 
> 
>When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.

If you do not use OpenAPI Specifications, please [contact us](https://join.slack.com/t/superflowsusers/shared_invite/zt-1zf93teqq-0I9H_niiGruVDPFVSzGj9w).
