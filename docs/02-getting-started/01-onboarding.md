# Onboarding

Superflows works by connecting a large language model to an API. It handles the process of going from a user query to having an answer given and actions taken.

## Setup

All the action happens on our [Dashboard](https://dashboard.superflows.ai/) - it's the control panel for your product assistant. Head there and follow the onboarding flow.

You will be prompted to choose whether you would like to 'Quickstart' or 'Build AI Assistant':

- **Quickstart** with a preconfigured assistant for a mockup product 

  - Recommended for those looking to try out Superflows
  - The next steps are:
    - Choose a preset assistant
    - Test in our playground

- [**Build AI Assistant**](./02-build-assistant) from scratch with your API specification
  - Recommended for those looking to set up their own project
  - The next steps are:
    - Upload your API Specification
    - Connect to your API (_Optional - you can mock the responses from your API_)
    - Test in our playground

The Quickstart flow is straightforward, so we'll focus on building your own AI assistant.
