# Action Descriptions

Superflows reads the description of an action to select which endpoint to call to answer queries. Changing an action description can therefore change the behaviour of the assistant.

### Editing Action Descriptions

Action descriptions can be edited from the [Dashboard Actions page](https://dashboard.superflows.ai/actions). Hover over the Action you want to edit, and click the three dots to bring up the editing interface. 

You can then edit the description in the text field. Make sure to save your changes at the bottom of the editing interface before exiting the interface.

### Guidance for Action Descriptions

It's best to use simple, clear language to describe actions. The description should accurately explain what the endpoint is for. It can also be helpful to emphasise key parameters.
