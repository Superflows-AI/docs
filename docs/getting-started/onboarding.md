# Onboarding

All the action happens on our [Dashboard](https://dashboard.superflows.ai/). Think of it as the control panel for your product copilot. 

Here you can upload your API spec, control the actions available to the chatbot, monitor usage, and test in our playground

When you hit this page for the first time, you'll need to make a new account. You can either do this with an email address and password or with a Google account. 

There are two places you can start: 
- [**Quickstart**](./quickstart/selecting-copilot) with a preconfigured copilot for an existing product 
    - Recommended for those looking to play with Superflows
- [**Build Copilot**](./build-copilot/api-upload) from scratch with your API information
    - Recommended for those looking to set up their own project

### Account setup

You can sign-up to Superflows with a Google account or an email address. 

To use your **Google account**, simply click 'Sign up with Google' when prompted. To use your email address, select **'Sign up with email'**.

### Organisation setup 

After creating an account, you will prompted to create a new organisation. This enables your team to coordinate on the same Superflows copilot. 

You'll be prompted to provide a name for your organisation.
