# Selecting Actions

NOTE: When you deselect or select a group of actions in bulk, the memory of which Actions were previously selected is currently not persisted. If you have configured a large number of actions, be careful when bulk selecting or deselecting groups of actions.

To bulk change the Actions by their 'tab', navigate to the tab, and click tick on the top left hand corner of the box. This will either activate or deactivate all actions within that tab, depending on it's current state. 

To bulk change actions by their HTTP request type, navigate to the top of the Actions page, and use the 'Enable HTTP method' dropdown menu. Here you can select or deselect all Actions that correspond to that HTTP method. The behaviour is similar to bulk selecting or deselecting actions by tab.
