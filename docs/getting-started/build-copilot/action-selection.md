# Selecting actions

After uploading your API spec you should be able to see actions in the Actions tab. 

By default, all of the 'GET' HTTP requests in your API will be selected. You can change this by clicking each individual endpoint (or 'Action' in Superflows terminology) to toggle them on or off, or in bulk by 'tab' or HTTP method.

### Number of actions selected

Superflows works best when less than 20 Actions are selected. To get started, we therefore recommend selecting a set of actions smaller than 20 that you are most interested in testing.

We are working on improving this, but more tuning of the Action descriptions in your API Spec or the description of the functionality of the copilot (coming later) may be required if you are using more than 20 actions. For many products, 20 actions is more than enough, but for some more complex products more are required, and some tuning will be needed.

### Bulk action selection

You can also change these in bulk by either the 'tab' the Actions belong to, or by the type of the HTTP request. More details about this functionality can be found on the [Configuration page of the documentation](../../category/configuration/)

For now, we'll continue to testing in the playground.
