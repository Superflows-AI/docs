# Next steps

If you built your own assistant, you are now ready to get your assistant ready for production. You can find more information about each of the steps you might want to take within these documentation pages:

- **Testing**: [Playground](../category/playground)
- **Configuration**: [Configuration](../category/configuration)
- **Deployment**: [API](../08-api-specification/answers.md), [UI Components](../07-ui-components)

If you used a preset assistant, you may now want to build your own. To do so, you can head back to the start of this Getting Started guide and follow the ['Build assistant' flow](./02-build-assistant).

Or just skip ahead to other parts of the documentation in the left hand sidebar.
