# API Spec Requirements

Superflows accepts the open standard '[OpenAPI Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0)' to read API Specifications. Versions 2.0+ are accepted, earlier versions may throw an error.

OpenAPI specifications should be uploaded in .json format.

### About OpenAPI Specifications

OpenAPI Specifications are an open industry standard for defining APIs. A full definition and description can be found on the [OpenAPI Initiative website](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0).

The initiatives website describes the specification format as follows:

>*The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. 
> 
>When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.

If you do not use OpenAPI Specifications, please contact our support team [TODO: ADD SUPPORT LINK].
