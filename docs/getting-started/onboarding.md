# Onboarding

Superflows works by connecting an API to a large language model. It handles the process of going from a user query about a product to having an answer given and actions taken. 

All the action happens on our [Dashboard](https://dashboard.superflows.ai/). Think of it as the control panel for your product copilot. 

## Setup steps

To get setup, head to our [Dashboard](https://dashboard.superflows.ai/). 

When you hit the Dashboard for the first time, you'll need to make a new account and organisation. 

You will then be prompted to choose whether you would like to Quickstart or Build a Copilot:
- [**Quickstart**](./quickstart) with a preconfigured copilot for an existing product
    - Recommended for those looking to play with Superflows
    - The next steps are: 
        - Choose a preset copilot
        - Test in our playground
- [**Build Copilot**](./build-copilot) from scratch with your API information
    - Recommended for those looking to set up their own project
    - The next steps are:
        - Upload an API Specification
        - Connect your API (*Optional - you can use test mode*)
        - Test in our playground
