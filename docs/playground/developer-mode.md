# Developer mode

Developer modes enables you to see the thought process and API calls the copilot performed to arrive at it's answer. This is useful when checking whether the copilot is functioning properly and debugginig performance issues.

In developer mode, a typical output will show:
- Reasoning
- Plan
- Commands
- Tell user

The reasoning step is to enable the AI to process the request and understand what the user wants. 

The planning steps lays out a series of actions that will be required to action this request. 

The command step shows the API calls the copilot will make to get the information required. 

And the tell user step processes this data into an chat output to send to the user. 

### Activating Developer mode

The Developer mode can be toggled on and off in the top left hand corner of the main chat interface in the Playground.
