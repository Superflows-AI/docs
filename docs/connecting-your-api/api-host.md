# API Host

Superflows needs to know where to send API requests. This is defined in the 'Project' tab of the Dashboard in the 'API Settings' box in the 'API Host' field:

`Dashboard / Project / API Settings / API Host`

[TODO: Screenshot]

The API host should be the url where your API is hosted.

[TODO: PROVIDE EXAMPLES]

This should be in the form of a string. It will typically start with `'https://'`.
