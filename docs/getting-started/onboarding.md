# Onboarding

Superflows works by connecting an API to a large language model. It handles the process of going from a user query about a product to having an answer given and actions taken. 

## Setup

All the action happens on our [Dashboard](https://dashboard.superflows.ai/) - it's the control panel for your product copilot. Head there and follow the onboarding flow.

You will be prompted to choose whether you would like to Quickstart or Build a Copilot:
- [**Quickstart**](./quickstart) with a preconfigured copilot for an existing product
    - Recommended for those looking to play with Superflows
    - The next steps are: 
        - Choose a preset assisant
        - Test in our playground


- [**Build Copilot**](./build-copilot) from scratch with your API information
    - Recommended for those looking to set up their own project
    - The next steps are:
        - Upload an API Specification
        - Connect your API (*Optional - you can use test mode*)
        - Test in our playground

## Next steps

Follow the Getting Started flow depending on which option you chose:

- ### [Build Copilot flow](./build-copilot)
- ### [Quickstart flow](./quickstart)
