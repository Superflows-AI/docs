# Introduction

This guide covers how to setup Superflows. 

It starts with a 'Getting Started' section, best suited for those new to Superflows. It details how to setup your account, organisation, upload your first API Spec, and interact in with our testing environment. 

Later in the documentation, we cover the different customisations available through Superflows, including selecting which actions are available to the copilot and adding our pre-built UI elements to your product. 

Before you know it, you'll have a chat interface to your product, able to guide users and take valuable actions.

Let's get your first copilot **running in our playground in less than 5 minutes**.
