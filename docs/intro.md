# Introduction

This guide covers how to set up Superflows. 

Superflows makes it easy to add an AI assistant that can help users use your product. It can take actions based on user questions, like ChatGPT plugins but within your product.

Superflows is designed to be low-code and easy to use. In our user friendly dashboard, you can control the behaviour of your product assistant, change which actions it can take, and test in a chat playground.
