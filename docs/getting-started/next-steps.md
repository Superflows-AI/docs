# Next steps

If you built your own Copilot, you are now ready to get your Copilot ready for production. You can find more information about each of the steps you might want to take within these documentation pages:

- **Testing**: [Playground](../category/playground)
- **Configuration**: [Configuration](../category/configuration)
- **Deployment**: [API](../api), [UI Components](../ui-components)

If you used a preset Copilot, you may now want to build your own. To do so, you can head back to the start of this Getting Started guide and follow the ['Build Copilot' flow](./build-copilot).

Or just skip ahead to other parts of the documentation in the left hand sidebar.
