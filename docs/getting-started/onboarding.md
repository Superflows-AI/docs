# Onboarding

Superflows works by connecting a large language model to an API. It handles the process of going from a user query to having an answer given and actions taken. 

## Setup

All the action happens on our [Dashboard](https://dashboard.superflows.ai/) - it's the control panel for your product assistant. Head there and follow the onboarding flow.

You will be prompted to choose whether you would like to 'Quickstart' or 'Build AI Assistant':

- **Quickstart** with a preconfigured assistant for an existing product
    - Recommended for those looking to try out Superflows
    - The next steps are: 
        - Choose a preset assisant
        - Test in our playground


- [**Build AI Assistant**](./build-assistant) from scratch with your API information
    - Recommended for those looking to set up their own project
    - The next steps are:
        - Upload an API Specification
        - Connect your API (*Optional - you can use test mode*)
        - Test in our playground

The Quickstart flow is self-serve and straightforward, so we'll focus on building your own AI assistant.
