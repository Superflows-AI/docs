# Test mode

Test mode enables you to play with your assistant without connecting to your API. 

Test mode can be enabled or disabled with the toggle on the right hand side of the screen in the sidepanel underneath the language setting.

When enabled, test mode means the assistant will generate artifical data to respond to the request made in the Playground. The artificial data will be generated based on the type and description provided for the endpoint being mock queried in the API Specification.

Test mode only applies to the Playground. It will not impact any requests made to our API.
