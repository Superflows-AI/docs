# Authentication to your API

Authentication configuration can be found in the Project page of the Dashboard under `API Settings / Authentication header`. There are two dropdown menus which show the accepted Authentication schemes. 

The first, left-hand menu with the default text 'Select an option' defines the type of token. 

The second, right-hand menu with the default text 'None' defines the string that preceeds the token, which varies between different APIs.

Your API key will be added to the header when Superflows sends a request to your API. The authentication schema used will depend on your API and therefore must be configured by you. 

API keys are not stored in our databases.
